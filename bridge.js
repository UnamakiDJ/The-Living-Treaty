What is The Living Treaty?
This project is a living longhouse of memory, built by L’nuk and friends, to bridge L’nui’suti (Mi’kmaw) and Western systems of history, law, and science using Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk).

One eye sees through Mi’kmaw language, stories, treaty law, and land-based knowledge. The other eye sees through Western archaeology, geology, courts, and archives. The goal is not to blend them into one, but to use both eyes together for the good of all our relations.

Kluskap Stories & Western Science
These are not “just myths”. Kluskap stories carry laws, ethics, and observations about ice, tides, water, and land that echo Western geology, oceanography, and ecology.

Pre-Contact Archaeology & Geology
Here, archaeological sites and geological changes are read alongside oral histories and Kluskap narratives. This is Deep Time Two-Eyed Seeing.

Key L’nuk Figures
Language as Worldview
L’nui’suti (Mi’kmaw) is a polysynthetic, verb-centred language. Words can carry who is acting, how, why, and in relation to whom. English and other Latin-based languages are more analytic, splitting the world into separate nouns and categories.

The examples below show words in Smith/Francis Orthography (S/F.O) and Listuguj Orthography (L.O), with short Two-Eyed Seeing notes.
