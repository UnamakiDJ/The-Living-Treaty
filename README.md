# The Living Treaty

**The-Living-Treaty** is a living project built by a Mi'kmaw person exploring how
technology can serve language revitalization, land-based knowledge, and Two-Eyed
Seeing (Etuaptmumk).

This repository is both:

- A **technical framework** (code, structures, data models), and  
- A **cultural vessel** (Mi’kmaw language, stories, history, teachings).

Because of that, it uses a **dual-license structure**.

## 👤 About the Builder

This project was created by a Mi'kmaw person working to:

- Build a **bridge** between L’nui’suti (Mi’kmaw language) and Western code/data  
- Use **Two-Eyed Seeing** as a design principle, not just a slogan  
- Protect Mi’kmaw knowledge from extraction while allowing learning and solidarity  
- Show that language, law, land, and code can sit together in the same “longhouse”

If you use this project:

- Respect that it comes from lived experience, grief, resistance, and love  
- Remember that this is not “public domain content” – it is shared under conditions of relationship
